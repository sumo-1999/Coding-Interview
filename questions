How does substring() inside String works.
Internal Implementation
The substring() method is implemented in the String class in Java. When the substring() method is called on a string object, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) creates a new string object and copies the required characters from the original string object to the new string object
What is classloader.
In Java, a ClassLoader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that dynamically loads Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It plays a crucial role in the execution of Java programs by managing the loading of classes and their dependencies
How is the creation of a String using new() different from that of a literal.
What is the difference between Executor.submit() and Executor.execute() method.
What do you understand by  Java memory Model ?
How to make class immutable? What purpose does it solve.
To make a class as an immutable class.
  1.Make the class as a final class so that no one can inherit it.
  2.Make all the member variable as private final.
  3.Only getter method, no setter method.
  4.Only the Constructor initialization
  5.Return the clone or comp of a mutable variable(like HashMap)
Purpose it solve:
Thread Safety: Immutable classes are inherently thread-safe because their state cannot be changed once created. This eliminates the need for synchronization mechanisms, making them more efficient and easier to use in multi-threaded environments
Can you use HashMap in the multi-threaded environment ? What can be the problem?
Can you write a critical section code for the Singleton ?
What is Singleton? Is it better to make the whole method synchronized or only the critical section synchronized.
How do you avoid deadlock in Java.
How can you avoid Serialization in the child class if the base class is implementing the Serializable interface.
What is ConcurrenHashMap in Java and do you implement it.
Explain the Fail-Fast Iterator and Fail-Safe Iterator along with example for each.
What is the difference between checked and unchecked exception.
What is the difference between factory and abstractfactory pattern.
What is Marker Interface.
When finally block doesn’t get executed ?
The finally block will not be executed if the program exits (either by calling System.exit() or by causing a fatal error (such as a OutOfMemoryError)that causes the process to abort).
How does Java garbage collection works.
Difference between ClassNotFound vs NoClassDefError.
How to break singleton.






Questions for Preparation:



How will you modify an existing spring boot application to serverless architecture.
What is Circular Dependency. How will you resolve the circular dependency.
Do you know about try-with-resource
What are SOLID Principle. (Single Responsibility Principle,Open-Exension Principle,Liskov substitution Principle,Interfcate Segregation Principle,Dependency Inversion Principle)
How Microservices communicate with each other.(Generally communicate over the network)(RestTemplate)
There is 1 micro-service that is taking more time to give the result.How will you handle it(we will specify the timeout to the restTemplate bean).
What is Horizontal Scaling and Vertical scaling.
What type of Scaling happend in MySql Database 

(Scaling a MySQL database involves a combination of vertical and horizontal scaling techniques. Vertical scaling is simpler but limited by hardware constraints. Horizontal scaling, involving replication and sharding, provides greater scalability and fault tolerance but introduces complexity in terms of data consistency, conflict resolution, and application logic. The choice of scaling strategy depends on the specific requirements, workload, and growth projections of the application.)

        random.ints(1,100).limit(10).sorted().forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
