Functional Interface: which helps to achieve functional programming approach through lambda and method references
	1. one abstract method 
	2. defualt methods
	3. static methods
	4. Object class methods
fi can not extends another interface which can have abstract method. So fi extends non-fi 
---------
 forEach() method is of Iterable interface that is used to iterate through a collection. Here it takes an argument of Consumer type interface. 
 This is a functional interface having only one abstract method called accept(). Since it is a functional interface, a lambda expression can be passed.
